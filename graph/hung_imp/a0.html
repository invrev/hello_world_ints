<h2>Assignment 0, Due at 11:59pm, Sunday Aug 31</h2>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
 <li>Edit and compile your first (?) C++ program.
 <li>Get used to the submit system.
 <li>Report on what you did the first week in terms of getting a hold of
 <code>g++</code> and a text editor on your home/laptop computer.
 <li>Try a simple <code>Makefile</code>
 <li>Get free points as a gift from me!
</ul>

<h3>What to do</h3>
<p></p>

Please perform the following tasks.

<ol>
 <li> In (a subdirectory) of your home directory of your CSE account,
 create a sub-directory called <code>A0</code> by typing

<pre>
mkdir A0
cd A0
</pre>

 <li> Create three files in that sub-directory named <code>report.cpp</code>,
 <code>Makefile</code>, and <code>README</code>. File names are case sensitive! 
 It is recommended that you use either
 <code>emacs/xemacs</code> or <code>vi/vim</code> to edit those files.
 <code>nano</code> would be OK too if you are not yet comfortable with
 <code>vi/emacs</code>. You can also edit the files using your favorite editor
 (<code>Eclipse</code>, <code>Nodepad++</code>, <code>sublime text</code>, etc.)
 from your home/laptop OS and upload them to your CSE account. 
 There's no way I know how you did it.
 <li> Type the following piece of code to <code>report.cpp</code>
 (please do not cut-and-paste, though I wouldn't know if you cut-and-pasted or
 typed, I'd recommend typing to get a sense of the editor, the C++ syntax, and
 indentation, ...)

<pre  class="prettyprint" id="Cpp">
// report.cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string my_name = "David Blaine"; // edit this
    string my_text_editor = "emacs"; // edit this
    string my_home_os = "Windows";   // edit this
    bool i_worked = true;            // set to false if you didn't do work
    
    cout << "My name is " << my_name << endl;

    if (i_worked) {
        cout << "I was able to install and test g++ and "
             << "the text editor " << my_text_editor << '\n'
             << "in my home computer/laptop, which runs "
             << my_home_os << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "I wasn't able to install and test g++ and/or a text "
             << "editor because ... " // give a lame reason here
             << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
</pre>

You must modify the program so that it reports things about you.
Now, to compile the above program, you can do
<code>g++ report.cpp</code>
and run it with <code>a.out</code>. 
However, I'd like you to try an extremely
simple <code>Makefile</code> too.

<li>Create a file named <code>Makefile</code> in the same directory whose content consists of the following lines:

<pre  class="prettyprint">
all:
	g++ report.cpp

clean:
    rm -f a.out
</pre>
For the <code>Makefile</code> to work, it is crucial that there is exactly
one tab before <code>g++</code> on the second line, and there is exactly one tab before <code>rm</code> on the 5th line. (The 3rd line is empty.)

Then, when you type <code>make</code> at the command line you'll get the same
effect as if you were typing <code>g++ report.cpp</code>. You can run the program by typing <code>a.out</code> or <code>./a.out</code> if your <code>$PATH</code> variable was not set correctly.

<li>Create a file named <code>README</code> with the following content:

<pre class="prettyprint">
Name: David Blaine       // please replace with YOUR name
Person number: 1234-5678 // please replace with YOUR person numer
</pre>

</ol>

<h3>How to submit</h3>

Now that you have three files (hopefully working!) in the directory. There might also be the <code>a.out</code> file that was compiled and run. We do not want you to submit executables, only the source files. Hence, please type

<pre class"prettyprint">
make clean
</pre>
 at the prompt before submitting. The effect is to remove the <code>a.out</code> file, if any, that was created.

 <p>
 Finally, to submit, create a tar ball of the directory as follows.

<pre>
cd ..
tar -cvf A0.tar A0/*
submit_cse250 A0.tar
</pre>

Note that the last line only works if you logged in to your CSE account and 
the tar file is there. All previous things can be done at home, as long as 
you remember to upload the final tar file to your CSE account and run the 
submit script from there.

<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>20 points: <code>README</code> is there
 <li>50 points: <code>report.cpp</code> compiles and works as requested
 <li>30 points: <code>Makefile</code> works
</ul>
