<h2>Assignment 1, Due at 11:59pm, Sunday Sep 07</h2>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
 <li> Write your first non-trivial C++ program, making use of basic control
 structures.
 <li> Familiarize yourself with elementary processing of strings and files in C++.
 <li> Think about program design: "design, then code." 
      It is very important that you think about the design of your program 
      before sitting down and coding.   
</ul>

<h3>What to do</h3>

You are to write a C++ program that does the following. 

<ol>
 <li> It keeps reading user's inputs, line by line. Each input line the user
 types is supposed to be in one of the following three forms:

 <pre>
numcols filename
numrows filename
exit
</pre>

where 
<ul>
 <li> <code>filename</code> is the name of a text file. The file contains a set of lines; each line is a list of words separated by spaces or tabs. Each word is a series of (ASCII) characters with no tab nor space in between them. For example, the content of the file <code>test.txt</code> might look like this
 <pre>
 this is    a file
 that has seven columns and four rows. 
 Note that rows might have 
 different numbers of columns.</pre>
 In this file, the first row has 4 words, second has 7, third has 5, and fourth has 4.
 <li> <code>numcols</code> stands for "number of columns" of <code>filename</code>, which is the maximum number of words that a row has.
 <li> <code>numrows</code> stands for "number of rows", which is the number of lines in the file. 
 <li> <code>exit</code> tells your program to quit 
</ul>

 <li> If the user types <code>exit</code>, then your program quits.
 <li> The other two commands <code>numrows</code> and <code>numcols</code> reports the number of columns and the number of rows the file has.

 <li> For example, if the file <code>test.txt</code> has the content as shown above, then the output of the program looks as follows.
<pre>
&gt; numrows test.txt
4
&gt; numcols test.txt
7
&gt; numcols anothertest.txt
6
&gt; exit
</pre>
Here, <code>anothertest.txt</code> is some other file that has 6 columns.
Your program has to keep running until the user types <code>exit</code>.
</ol>

<h3>My implementation</h3>

I have written <a href="txtparser">a program named <code>txtparser</code></a> following the above specification and compiled it under <code>timberlake</code>. You can download and run it (in <code>timberlake</code>) to see how it is supposed to work. You can download it by clicking on the link above (and upload the file to <code>timeberlake</code>), or you can log on to your CSE account on <code>timberlake</code>, then type

<pre>
wget http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~hungngo/classes/2014/Fall/250/assignments/txtparser
</pre>

Remember to make it an executable file before trying to run it:

<pre>
chmod 700 txtparser
</pre>

You can also get two test files using the same method:

<pre>
wget http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~hungngo/classes/2014/Fall/250/assignments/test.txt
wget http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~hungngo/classes/2014/Fall/250/assignments/anothertest.txt
</pre>

<h3>How to submit</h3>

Put all files in a directory named <code>A1</code>, then follow
the steps similar to assignment 0. You <strong>do</strong> need to construct a
<code>Makefile</code> for it. If your <code>cpp</code> source file is named <code>txtparser.cpp</code>, then your <code>Makefile</code> might have the following content

<pre>
all:
    g++ txtparser.cpp -o txtparser

clean:
    rm -f txtparser
</pre>

To submit, perform similar steps as in assignment 0.

<pre>
cd ..
tar -cvf A1.tar A1/*
submit_cse250 A1.tar
</pre>

Note that the last line only works if you logged in to your CSE account and 
the tar file is there. All previous things can be done at home, as long as 
you remember to upload the final tar file to your CSE account and run 
the submit script from there.

<h3>Grading</h3>

<ul>
    <li> 10 points if the <code>exit</code> command works. Your program only quits when <code>exit</code> is typed.
    <li> 40 points if the <code>numcols</code> command works, outputting the correct number of columns of the input file.
    <li> 40 points if the <code>numrows</code> command works, outputting the correct number of rows of the input file.
    <li> 10 points if your program can handle simple input errors from the users,
 such as when the user types <code>numco file.txt</code> (unknown command)
 or when <code>file.txt</code> does not exist. Please run my implementation <code>txtparser</code> to see the expected behavior.
</ul>

Read Chapter 1 of the textbook if you needed to. Read the <a href="http://cse250.wordpress.com/2014/08/30/getting-started/">Getting started in C++</a> lecture note. The "reverse characters, reverse words" example already showed you how to get input lines from the user. The following snippet of code shows you how to read a file, one line at a time. Overall, you have all of the tools available to write this program.
